# quizmusic
An android app for playing a fixed number of audio clips

To build you will need to provide some resources.

- String resources answer_1...answer_10 in the strings.xml file
- In the res/raw directory audio files named question_1...question_10
- A background image called background in res/mipmap

This app is intended to present music quiz questions for screen sharing. The minimum SDK version is set as it is because that is the version of the device that I am using, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10. I am only testing on this device. It may therefore be the case that the layout looks odd on other devices.
